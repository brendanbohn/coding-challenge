#VB Coding Challenge
###Implement Infinite Scroll

###Instructions
* Clone this branch, run `npm install`, and then either `node start server.js` or `nodemon` from the root of this directory.
* Create a branch using git where you will implement infinite scroll.
* `localhost:3000` is the index page and `localhost:3000/v1/articles` is the articles api endpoint.
* Build an article out in index.html using the following page elements: title, author, tags, image, and content (at least 6 paragraphs) and then load the rest of the articles when the user hits the bottom of the page (50px from the bottom to be exact).
* Style the site in a way you think looks best. It doesn't have to look like our current site, the sky is the limit.
* Good luck!
