#VB Coding Challenge
###Implement Infinite Scroll

###Instructions
* Clone this branch and run nodemon from the root to start server.
* `localhost:3000` is the index page and `localhost:3000/v1/articles` is the articles api endpoint
* Build an article out in index.html using title, author, tags, image, and content (at least 6 paragraphs) and then load the rest of the articles when the user hits the bottom of the page (50px from the bottom to be exact).
* Style the site in a way you think looks best.
* Good luck!
